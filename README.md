# Qt App for HID device. 
The application was developed to enable visualization and easy use of an HID device based on an STM32 microcontroller and its connected peripherals, such as a TOF sensor, an OLED display, and encoders.

Both the application and the device itself allow users to perform various functions on a Windows computer, including adjusting volume, adding and switching remote desktops, toggling browser windows, and much more!

The application is bilingual, thanks to Qt Linguist, with support for both Polish and English.

The GUI was designed using Qt Creator.
